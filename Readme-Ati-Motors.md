1. Fork the given repo:
     This can be done by opening the given link in the assignment and you can click on "Fork" option on the right. This will prompt a fork page and you can give the desired name to the repo.
     This will create a new repo in your github account with the same contents as in the assignment repo
2. Jenkins:
     Before starting with Jenkins, installing jenkins by downloading the war file from google
     Open CMD and go to your downloads directory, using dir command in windows and cd command in linux os
     and run the "java -jar jenkins.war", if you already used jenkins on your system, you can now browse it on http://localhost:8080
     if this is the first time setting it up, store the password it displays and browse to the above url mentioned, use the password to setup your account and install the required dependancies
     but as the assignment said to use jenkins on port 3000, the simple way to do this is by running "java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=3000", this will open jenkins on port 3000
